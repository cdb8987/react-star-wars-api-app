# Star Wars Character Archives
For Data-Driven Star Wars Fans!..A place to search and explore your favorite characters.

## Description
I used React, Javascript and Bootstrap to build a Star Wars character search page.  Users can either explore fresh pages of 10 characters or search their favorite characters specifically.  I built this app to get comfortable with passing React props, using hooks and updating state in response to user input.  The most interesting challenge in this project was to make it update asynchronously in response to sequentially dependent API/resource calls while maintaining a good user experience.
